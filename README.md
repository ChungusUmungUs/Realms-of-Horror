# Realms-of-Horror
This was my first Twine game, and it was made for the 2022 ODU Mars Fest. It's an adaptation of the 1987 AD&D module collection featuring the Tomb of Horrors, White Plume Mountain, Expedition to the Barrier Peaks, and The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth. Due to the time constraints of game jams, the game only features the first half of the Tomb of Horrors (up to the false lich). I do not plan on updating it further at this time.

The main purpose of the project was just to get experience in Twine as I am using it for a research project, but it's also my first digital game jam piece.
